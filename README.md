# Object Oriented programming
In this module, you’ll create a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which the user battles a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by taking a potion. Your game will create new objects using JavaScript constructor functions, and you’ll also implement basic code tests using the Jest framework.
